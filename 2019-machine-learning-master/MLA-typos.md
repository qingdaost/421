# typos in Marsland

And any other comments specific to the book.

* one of the entires in Eqtn 2.3 - 2.6 is incorrect (which one?)

* in the bias-variance derivation, end of Ch 3:
  * there's an f+h at the end, should be f-h
  * I think it would be good to point out that an expectation is being taken over two very different things

* next thing here
